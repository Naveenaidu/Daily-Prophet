            Mustang has escaped Azkaban and has been controlling people’s hearts for the last three months. This exclusive report comes from one of her bewitched victims, who wishes to remain anonymous, but goes by the name of Pooh. <br> Pooh first encountered Mustang at a place called Eco World. From the moment he laid eyes on her, he claims she had some form of attraction powder on — she was, in his words, “the prettiest woman I’ve ever seen.” The memory of their first date still haunts him: the topics they spoke of, the desire he felt to kiss her lips, to grab her buttocks. He recalls a particularly mushy moment where he taught her how to make a boat — and just as he leaned in for that magical first kiss, she Lumos-ed the light, leaving him to work and wait for another chance. Since that day, Pooh never imagined he would actually become her boyfriend. Now, he confesses, “I’m in love, and she’s the drug I can’t live without.” Her eyes are his calm in the storm, her lips forever entangled with his, his hands always seeking hers to cuddle. Life, as he knew it, has faded — all he imagines now is a future with her. His normal duties have become impossible; Mustang invades his thoughts at every turn. </p>

He even treasures spending silent moments with her. As long as she’s beside him, he feels invincible. Some say this is the magic of true love.

              <p> A word of caution to our readers: Mustang is a master of advanced transfiguration. Reliable reports warn that she can shift her form at will — appearing as a radiant sunflower, a graceful manta ray, or even a harmless-looking bubble of happiness to evade capture. Should you encounter an unusually chatty — or suspiciously catty — stranger, or spot a sunflower too beautiful to belong, alert the Aurors without delay. Some whisper that they once knew Mustang before she turned to this path. To uncover the secrets of her origins, and what drove her to wield such power over hearts and minds — </p> -->

              The wizarding world stands at the brink of an unprecedented crisis, as the dark influence of Mustang spreads far beyond magical borders — infecting the hearts and minds of Muggles and wizards alike. Airports across the globe report mass flight cancellations, as Mustang’s bewitched followers abandon their duties, desperate for a mere glimpse or word with their elusive queen. From Aurors to airline pilots, no profession has been spared the enchantment. In a stunning turn, even the leaders of powerful Muggle nations have fallen under her spell. </p>

            <p>Reliable sources confirm that tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated — not over politics or power, but over Mustang herself. Both presidents, said to be utterly captivated by her, now threaten war in their quest to win her favor. “Never before has the wizarding world so collided with the affairs of Muggles,” warns a spokesperson from the Department of Magical Catastrophes. The Ministry urges calm — and vigilance — as they work tirelessly to contain the situation before love-struck chaos turns to all-out conflict.</p>

The group — who wish to remain unnamed — quickly became disoriented among the towering trees and endless tangles of thorny bushes. But fortune favored them: one of the wizards, showing uncommon foresight, had packed the legendary Marauder’s Map — and, curiously, a packet of Maggi. </p>

              The trio now calls this night a core memory — a tale of thorns, hunger, magic, and survival that they will cherish for a lifetime.</p>

            <p class="wand-cap">Disaster struck the wizarding community yesterday as the nation’s only two wand shops were destroyed in the aftermath of a fierce and unexpected duel between two wizards. Sources say the conflict began over heated exchanges via wizard phones — taunts, charms, and provocative words that rapidly escalated, igniting tempers on both sides. Unable to resist the pull of battle, one wizard abandoned his gym, while the other left his office in haste </p>

          <div class="bodytext cabin mx-3">
            <p> They met at an undisclosed, secluded location — far from prying eyes — where wands were drawn for an intense, fiery clash. The duel, though lasting only ten minutes, left chaos in its wake: two wand shops in ruin, one wizard emerging with minor injuries, and a pillow tragically sacrificed in the skirmish.

              With Hogwarts’ new students left wondering where to buy their wands, the Ministry urges calm — and perhaps a touch less passion — among its citizens.
